# create-react-app exercise 2

This directory contains a react app bootstraped with create-react-app. It is mostly unaltered. Like
usual, run npm install to get the dependencies installed

Your goal is to make the tests executed by the following command pass
```
npm test
```

Alter the file src/App.js to make this test pass. To do so, get rid of all the jsx in the render
method and render the following instead:
```
<div>Hello React</div>
```
