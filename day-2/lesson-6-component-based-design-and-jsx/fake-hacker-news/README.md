# Component based design and JSX tutorial

This React app will be a *very* basic prototype for a clone of [Hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com)

A working solution can be found in hacker-news-one-component, but the whole thing is one giant component
Use the component based design to break these down into smaller components inside of *this* project. All
of the classes have been stubbed out as a starting point

run the following command to set things up
```
npm install
```
And this command to run the test suite
```
npm test
```

For extra credit, flesh out the implementation further by adding more parts from the real site. No
dynamic data just yet, but we'll get there soon!
