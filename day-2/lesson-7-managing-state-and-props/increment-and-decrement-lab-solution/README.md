# Increment and Decrement Lab

In this lab you will write a simple counter app that displays the current count, has
a button to increment the count, and a button to decrement the count. Currently the current
score of 0 is being displayed, along with the increment and decrement buttons, but the buttons
don't work and the tests don't pass. Add functionality to the buttons such that the app works
and the tests pass

like usual run this command to setup:
```
npm install
```

And this command to fun the tests:
```
npm test
```
